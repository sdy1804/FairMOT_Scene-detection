# FairMOT-Scene-detection

## Introduction
In swimming competition video, there are some scenes that repeatly occured when swimmers do competition.     
I classified some scenes - On-block, Diving, Swimming, Turning, Finish.    
Optimized hyper-parameters were different for each classes, so I utilized these classes.    
After classification head classified scene classes, hyper-parameters are changed by each optimized values for classes.
